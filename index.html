<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; color: #333333; font-family: gotham, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>transitMaps</strong> is a simple web application <span style="font-weight: 400;">that allows users to identify regions of Houston where <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;">users to identify regions of Houston that have &ldquo;fast&rdquo; public transportation services. </span><span style="color: #000000; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;">Understanding where fast transit is available is a key part of ensuring that public transportation is meeting the needs of communities across Houston - it indicates whether service is available to riders when they need it, and how much time they&rsquo;ll spend </span><span style="color: #000000; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;">waiting</span><span style="color: #000000; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;"> to travel to their destinations.</span> </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; color: #333333; font-family: gotham, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here we think about "fast transit" in terms of frequency and availability.</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; color: #333333; font-family: gotham, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Frequency describes how often a vehicle stops along a bus route: every 15 minutes, once an hour, etc. </span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; color: #333333; font-family: gotham, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Availability describes when a particular service is available. For example, a route might be in service Monday through Friday, from 6AM to 10 PM. <br /></span></span></li>

<p><span style="font-family: gotham, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;"><strong><span style="color: #333333;">About this project:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; color: #333333; font-family: gotham, helvetica, sans-serif;">In collaboration with LINK Houston, a transportation advocacy organization, I am developing a user-friendly software application that allows users to identify regions of Houston that have &ldquo;fast&rdquo; public transportation services. Houston is in the midst of expanding it&rsquo;s public transportation system. Over the next 20 years, Houston and the surrounding region is expected to grow from a population of 6 million people to over 10 million people, and to accommodate all this growth the city is investing in a transit system that has to meet a wide variety of needs. As the city plans for this growth, LINK Houston is working to ensure that the future of transportation in Houston is an equitable one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px; color: #333333; font-family: gotham, helvetica, sans-serif;">When completed, LINK Houston can use this tool to support community advocacy for improvements in transit services. In the future LINK Houston may also use the tool to support community advocacy for affordable housing investments where &ldquo;good&rdquo; transit exists.</span></p>
